## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This was the first project I did at 42 S√£o Paulo:
an implementation of many `stdlib.h` functions from scratch.

I've used this on all other projects that followed.
I learned about memory manipulations, string utilities and linked lists.
As a developer I've been using all these functions for years
in some form or another,
but I had no idea how they worked until I did this project.

So far it has about 160 usable functions,
including a heap-less `printf` that handles `float`s and `long double`s.
The implementations are simple and readable,
and they all have a documentation comment.
I'll be adding more functions to it as I progress through 42's many projects.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

All you need is a shell and a C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.

### üñ•Ô∏è Installing

To compile the entire thing just clone the repo and run `make`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/librity/ft_libft.git
$ cd ft_libft
$ make
```

This will generate a `libft.a` archive, which you can compile with
any of the example files:

```bash
$ cp examples/ft_itoa.c examples/example.c
$ gcc -g -I ./includes examples/example.c libft.a
$ ./a.out
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can call most `stdlib.h` functions as you normally would
but with the prefix `ft_`:

```c
ft_putstr("Hello, world!\n");
```

## ‚úÖ Tests <a name = "tests"></a>

This project is partly tested with the
[Unity framework](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity).
To run all tests, run `make`'s `test` rule:

```bash
make tests
```

## üõ∏ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
